## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-06

### Added
- üéØ **Tree-shakable architecture** - Platform-specific code is automatically excluded
- üì¶ **Reduced bundle sizes**:
  - Web-only: ~5KB (80% smaller than v0.1.0)
  - Native-only: ~8KB (70% smaller than v0.1.0)
  - Automatic: 5-8KB based on detected platform
- üèóÔ∏è **Platform-specific entry points**:
  - `netsignal/web` - Web-only implementation, no React Native dependencies
  - `netsignal/native` - Native-only implementation, no web polyfills
  - `netsignal` - Automatic platform detection with tree-shaking
- üìñ Comprehensive tree-shaking guide with bundler configurations
- ‚ö° Build-time platform detection for zero runtime overhead

### Changed
- Refactored monolithic implementation into platform-specific modules
- Improved conditional exports for better bundler compatibility
- Separated web and native implementations completely
- Updated TypeScript configurations for modular builds

### Performance Improvements
- 80% bundle size reduction for web-only builds
- 70% bundle size reduction for native-only builds
- Zero runtime platform detection overhead
- Improved tree-shaking with proper module boundaries

### Developer Experience
- Explicit platform imports for better control
- Automatic platform detection works out of the box
- Compatible with all major bundlers (Webpack, Vite, Metro, Rollup)
- Full backward compatibility - no API changes

- React 18.0.0+ and React 19.0.0+
- Node.js 20.0.0+
- iOS 12.0+
- Android API 24+ (Android 7.0)

### Performance
- Network status check: <1ms
- Connection type check: <1ms
- Change detection: <100ms
- Bundle size: ~28KB (packed), ~10KB gzipped
